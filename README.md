### Data Analytics and Visualization
1. **Data analytics** involves the process of analyzing raw data to derive insights and make informed decisions. It encompasses various techniques such as data cleaning, data mining, and data modeling.
2. **Visualization** plays a crucial role in data analytics by presenting complex data in a visual format, making it easier to understand patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
   Popular tools for data visualization include Tableau, Power BI, and Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### Probability and Statistics
1. **Probability** is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur, while statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. Probability theory forms the foundation of statistics, providing methods for describing uncertainty and making predictions based on data. Key concepts in probability and statistics include probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
